# Inheritance

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is when an object or class is based on another object (prototypal inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), using the same implementation (inheriting from an object or class: inheriting behavior, programming by difference) or specifying a new implementation to maintain the same behavior (realizing an interface).
